## 🔐 VPN Encryption and Privacy Research

**VPN Used:** ProtonVPN (Free Plan)

### 🔑 Encryption & Protocols.
- **AES-256** or **ChaCha20** encryption
- **OpenVPN** and **WireGuard** protocols
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy** – new keys for every session

### 🔒 Privacy Features:
- No-logs policy (no tracking or data retention)
- DNS leak protection
- Internet kill switch
- Secure Core (multi-hop routing)
- Tor over VPN

---

## ⚠️ VPN Limitations
- Does **not** block malware or phishing attacks
- Logged-in websites (e.g., Google) can still track activity
- Browser fingerprinting and cookies may still work
- Speed can be reduced depending on server load

---

## 🔐 Benefits of VPN
 -Masks real IP address, hides actual location.
 -Encrypts internet traffic, protecting data from hackers on public WiFi.
 -Helps bypass geo-restrictions.
